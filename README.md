# Meringue Knulli theme

An interpretation of [Primal (MeringuePersonnal)](https://www.reddit.com/user/MeringuePersonal3407/) theme found on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1ix9124/my_collection/).<br />

Compatible with [Knulli](https://knulli.org/) (tested), [Retrobat](https://www.retrobat.org/accueil-fr/) (tested), [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) (not tested).<br />
Support 4:3, 3:2, 1:1, 16:9 aspect ratios with simple game grid.<br />

If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
At the moment almost everything comes from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)<br>

All tiled backgrounds images are generated using [those tools](https://github.com/kthod861/Boxart_Project)<br>
