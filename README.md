If by any chance you've a system folder with enough good looking boxarts and are willing to share, please ping me !<br />
At the moment almost everything comes from [libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)<br>

All tiled backgrounds images are generated using [those tools](https://github.com/kthod861/Boxart_Project)<br>
